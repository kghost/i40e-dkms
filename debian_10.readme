we have added a patch for debian 10.  If you use the standard debian 10 kernel,eg:
 * linux-image-4.19.0-17-amd64

In debian release 10.11 the default kernel is:
 * linux-image-4.19.0-18-amd64

In this kernel there are some backports from kernel 5.4.0 and the driver does not
compile anymore. SURF included a simple patch to fix this:
 * cd src
 * patch < ../debian10.patch

This  patch compiles for old and new debian kernels
